# COIN_DECIDER.app
coin decider app, coming soon, thanks everybody

this is only for astons eyes only, fuck off anyone else, its a secret

whats good aston, i made a git hub reposatory for you,
could you help me make a app using xcode + swift code,
its called coin decider, its just a coin flipping app,
its like 99usd to have an app on the IOS app store, but thats fine ill pay for that no worrys,

the problem is i dont have a mac,,, so i cant use xcode.
so i was wondering if you could help me and we can do it on your mac,

i think we should do this together inperson though becuase i wanna watch and learn from you, plus we should hang out bro, ill buy you dinner if your hungry.
my dad has a mac but hes too scared to update to the latest software update becuase he is scared about it breaking stuff or something - and xcode only runs on the latest software update :(

anyways - what you can find in here,
assets - the coin i have made- it has 2 sides like most coins have, one is head (coin_skull) and otherside is tails (coin_loon)
there is also 2 PNG sequences - the first seqence is coin_flip_loon - an anaimation (the coin lands on tails) and vice verse coin_flip_skull
im sure your getting this your very smart probly dont need to explain - but when i write in this README.md it feels like im a real coder.


there is also 2 .mp3 files, for audio feedback when the coin is flipped
loon_sound + skull_sound - this is when it lands it plays a sound - prettyt self explanatory - just a extra little touch becuase we are handsome geniuses.

and there is also a MUTE_ON + MUTE_OFF asset - for mutting the sound, yes ive thought of everything,

and last but not least - COIN_DECIDER_TITTLE.PNG 
this is the tittle for the top the app - we can have it just static there because thats easy -
but it would be cool to have a left to right carosel effect - i think thats the right name for it but like looping left from right 
<<<COIN DECIDER<<<<<<COIN DECIDER<<<<<<<<COIN DECIDER<<<<<< that type of thing - im sure you get that actually,

anyways what else,

o last thing the background is just simple red background - the hex code is #FF0021

cool i think thats everything -
i will try put a snippet of the swift code in there i will be called - ContentView.swift

thats all i have for now - feel like we dont need anything else,
but maybe we do im not sure - we will cross that bridge when we discover that bridge if there is a bridge we havnt discoverd yet.

UPDATE# this is a proof of concept video https://youtu.be/g9ShW-a4LOI

cheers !
